World Population Simulator
==========================

The World Population Simulator is a program that calculates population growth. You can specify:

- total number of years
- initial conditions (eg. number of males, females, mothers, etc).
- maximum life expectancy
- average death rate
- probability of being male or female
- average number of children per mother
- lower and upper bounds on the age of mothers

The program will output the total world population for each year.
